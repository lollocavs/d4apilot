# Design4All Pilot App

## Description
This mobile app is developed by DT&M Group for evalute evaluate attitude to technology of elderly people.

According to the "Design for all" paradigm, a pilot study is planned, aimed at analysing the human system interaction of the developed interface, in order to gain information on adaptable and adaptive features.

For this purpose, three significant classes of users have been selected in order to have an appropriate users plethora, necessary to characterize  the different  usability and functionality levels of the interface and identify  different design proposals, these are:

* __Cognitive disorders users__: related to memory (indicators: procedural memory, short-term perspective) and Warning (indicators: visuo-spatial deficits, attention difficulties generalized);
* __Sensory impairments users__: related to View  (indicators: diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, colour blindness, macular degeneration, glaucoma) and Hearing (indicators: mild or moderate hearing loss);
* __Motor disorder users__:  (indicators: manipulation, the ability to make fine movements)


To this end, six key objectives have been identified: 

1. Evaluation of the tapping ability compared to  size, location and contrast of the icons.
2. Action of pinching skills assessment in relation to size, location, and contrast of the icons.
3. Pinch \& span ability evaluation in relation to size, location, and contrast of the icons.
4. Icons position adequacy assessment.
5. Text adequacy assessment.
6. Scroll on action ability evaluation.

The evaluation of the users' performance will be based on the analysis of:

* Adaptability of the text elements: font, text size, contrast and position of the text;
* Adaptivity of the icons: size, position and contrast;
* Adaptivity of Interface Layout: iconic, textual, hybrid;
* Subjective skills in the use of technology (tap, pinch, pinch span, scroll);
* Appropriateness of features characteristics.

The app is able to monitoring the __user interaction__ of the different sessions and
## Required tools
* Docker [[docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/)]
* Docker-compose [[docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)]


## Running the app
The app is refactored in order to work container-approach and to allow an easy deployment on every machine.

After installing the required tools, you can simply run the following command (if nodejs framework is installed):
```
npm run app
```
otherwise
```
docker-compose up --build
```
and Docker provides to download all dependencies, compile the project and run the working entities (node app and MongoDB database).


### 5. Configure Network Connection
The application is designed with a client-server architecture, so it is important that the server-side application (running on a pc or mac) and the client device (tablet) is in the same wifi network. 

When both physical device are connected to the same network, check the IP Address of server device (looks like ```xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx```).

From the mobile device, go to the web site : ```http:/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000``` and start to use the application.

and developed by [Lorenzo Cavalieri](mailto:lorenzocavalieri@icloud.com).

The application uses [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com), with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) to manage the server-side implementation.
